description: A zoom brush that filters the chart down to a draggable range of the data.

## Usage

Add `<EvilAreaChart.Brush />` as a child of the chart root. Its presence renders the brush footer — a miniature of the **full** dataset with a draggable selection window over it. Narrowing that window filters the main chart to the selected range; the miniature always keeps showing everything, so you never lose your place.

Set `xDataKey` on the root so the handles can label themselves with the value under each edge.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { EvilAreaChart } from '$lib/components/evilcharts/charts/layerchart-area-chart/index.js';
</script>

<EvilAreaChart {data} config={chartConfig} xDataKey="date">
	<EvilAreaChart.XAxis dataKey="date" />
	<EvilAreaChart.Brush formatLabel={(value) => String(value)} />
	<EvilAreaChart.Area dataKey="desktop" variant="gradient" />
</EvilAreaChart>
```

## Example

<ComponentPreview class="mb-0" title="<EvilAreaChart.Brush />" name="ex-brush-area-chart" />

<Alert>
  <AlertContent>

Drag either handle to resize the range, or drag the selected region itself to pan without changing its width. Handle labels fade in while the pointer is over the brush. Dragging is pointer-based, so mouse, touch, and pen all work.

## Supported Charts

The brush is available on the cartesian charts — `EvilAreaChart`, `EvilLineChart`, `EvilBarChart`, and `EvilComposedChart`. Attach it exactly the same way on each:

```svelte
<EvilLineChart.Brush />
<EvilBarChart.Brush />
<EvilComposedChart.Brush />
```

The miniature mirrors the chart it belongs to. Area and composed charts draw filled areas, line charts draw strokes only, and bar charts draw rounded bars — and it inherits the parent chart's `curveType`, stacking, bar radius, and series colors, so the footer always reads as the same chart in small.

The brush is hidden while the chart is in its loading state, and it never renders for the non-cartesian charts (pie, radar, radial, sankey), which have no continuous axis to zoom.

## Reacting to the Range

Filtering the chart is automatic — the root already slices its data to the selection. Pass `onChange` when something _outside_ the chart needs to follow along, such as a heading that reports the visible window:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	let range = $state({ startIndex: 0, endIndex: data.length - 1 });
</script>

<EvilAreaChart {data} config={chartConfig} xDataKey="date">
	<EvilAreaChart.Brush onChange={(next) => (range = next)} />
	<EvilAreaChart.Area dataKey="desktop" variant="gradient" />
</EvilAreaChart>

<!-- data[range.startIndex].date → data[range.endIndex].date -->
```

`onChange` fires with data **indices**, not values, so look the labels up on your own rows.

## API Reference

<ApiHeading>Brush</ApiHeading>

Composed as a child of the chart root. It renders nothing itself — its presence turns the brush footer on, and its props configure it.

<ApiTable>
  <ApiRow name="height" type="number" default="56">

Height of the brush preview strip in pixels.

</ApiRow>
  <ApiRow name="formatLabel" type="(value: unknown, index: number) => string">

Formats the range-handle labels from the `xDataKey` value under each edge. Defaults to the raw value.

</ApiRow>
  <ApiRow name="onChange" type="(range: &#123; startIndex: number; endIndex: number &#125;) => void">

Fires as the selection moves, with the inclusive data indices of the visible range.

</ApiRow>
</ApiTable>

<ApiHeading>Root</ApiHeading>

<ApiTable>
  <ApiRow name="xDataKey" type="string">

The data key the handle labels read from. Without it the handles fall back to raw indices.

</ApiRow>
</ApiTable>
